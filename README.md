# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

An advanced version of Tik Tac Toe built using a Java based GUI. The game has a large 3 by 3 grid each with a normal version of Tik Tac Toe within them. The game's smaller grids play like normal Tik Tac Toe and a player wins when they win 3 small grids in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There is an extra rule where the grid the current player can make a move is based on the move the previous player made. For example, if player 1 made a move in the second spot in a grid then player 2 has to make their move in grid 2.
